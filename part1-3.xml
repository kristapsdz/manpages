			Function Library
		</h2>
		<p>
			I've mentioned several times that the name provided to <a href="macros.xml#macro_nm" class="macro">Nm</a> doesn't
			necessarily refer to the title of the manual in <a href="macros.xml#macro_dt" class="macro">Dt</a>.  Let's study a
			simple function library, using both <span class="func">hi</span> and <span class="func">hello</span>, which demonstrates
			this concept.
		</p>
		<p>
			A function library is a collection of object files, which consist mainly of programming functions, within a single file
			called a library.  On most <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#unix">UNIX</a> systems, you can find libraries installed
			in <span class="path">/usr/local</span>, ending in <span class="file">.a</span> or <span class="file">.so</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This example applies to any number of functions belonging to the same library &mdash; not necessarily all functions in
			the library.  In fact, one commonly finds large libraries spread over many manuals, each of which contain several
			similar functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			For simplicity's sake, I'll call this C function library <span class="lib">libgreeting</span>, implying that the
			installed library is called <span class="file">libgreeting.a</span> or <span class="file">libgreeting.so</span>.  It
			will consist of two header files, <span class="header">hi.h</span> and <span class="header">hello.h</span>, containing
			the function prototypes for <span class="func">hi</span> and <span class="func">hello</span>, respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's begin with the first few macros, which are also called the manual prologue.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Dd May 30, 2011
			<br />
			.Dt GREETING 3
			<br />
			.Os
		</div>
		<p>
			Note that I've changed the document title to be <span class="screen">GREETING</span> instead of choosing between
			function names.  This is because the manual documents the entire function library, not just one particular function.  In
			general, a function library should have its name not include the leading <q>lib</q>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's a good rule of thumb that the <a href="macros.xml#macro_dt" class="macro">Dt</a> title of your document matches
			its filename.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, I'll list the names of the functions being documented.  I also change the description of the manual to be more
			generic, just in case I want to add new functions, later.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Sh NAME
			<br />
			.Nm hello ,
			<br />
			.Nm hi
			<br />
			.Nd print greeting messages
		</div>
		<p>
			Here I've used <a href="macros.xml#macro_nm" class="macro">Nm</a> twice to indicate that the manual documents two
			functions.  In doing so, I'll have to be careful when invoking <a href="macros.xml#macro_nm" class="macro">Nm</a> in
			later parts of the manual, as it will produce <span class="screen">hi</span> if I don't specify a name, and this is
			probably not desired (nor should it be depended upon, as I may re-order the names).
		</p>
		<p>
			If we were only documenting a single function in a library, we would only assign <a href="macros.xml#macro_nm"
				class="macro">Nm</a> and <a href="macros.xml#macro_nd" class="macro">Nd</a> to the relevant function and not
			that of the library.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's good practise to alphabetise the function names in the <span class="sec">NAME</span> section.  We must also be sure
			to comma-separate each name, leaving the last invocation without a comma.  Let's look at the output so far.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocout">
			<div class="mdoc-section">
				<h1>NAME</h1>
				<b class="mdoc-name">hello</b>, 
				<b class="mdoc-name">hi</b> &#8212; <span class="mdoc-desc">print greeting messages</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Even though that is hard to maintain and not very useful, some operating systems, for example FreeBSD and NetBSD,
			require a <span class="sec">LIBRARY</span> section for base system libraries.  For portable libraries,
			do not include such a section.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Sh LIBRARY
			<br />
			.Lb libgreeting
		</div>
		<p>
			This uses the macro <a href="macros.xml#macro_lb" class="macro">Lb</a>, which accepts the name of the library
			starting with <q>lib</q>.  This macro is not portable because the list of known library names is system
			dependent, so it will produce different output on different systems, which is not desirable for a manual page.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocout">
			<div class="mdoc-section">
				<h1>NAME</h1>
				<b class="mdoc-name">hello</b>, 
				<b class="mdoc-name">hi</b> &#8212; <span class="mdoc-desc">print greeting messages</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mdoc-section">
				<h1>LIBRARY</h1>
				<span class="mdoc-lib">library &#8220;libgreeting&#8221;</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			The <span class="sec">SYNOPSIS</span> section will simply be a collection of the calling syntaxes for both functions,
			which we've already studied.  If we were only documenting one function, would list only that function here.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Sh SYNOPSIS
			<br />
			.In hello.h
			<br />
			.In hi.h
			<br />
			.Ft int
			<br />
			.Fo hello
			<br />
			.Fa "int C" "const char *prefix"
			<br />
			.Fc
			<br />
			.Ft void
			<br />
			.Fn hi
		</div>
		<p>
			Note that I've listed both include files prior to the function prototypes.  This is familiar to C programmers, where
			functions may have multiple include files that need a specific order.  The functions are listed in the same order as
			their <a href="macros.xml#macro_nm" class="macro">Nm</a> listing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's examine the output so far.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocout">
			<div class="mdoc-section">
				<h1>NAME</h1>
				<b class="mdoc-name">hello</b>, 
				<b class="mdoc-name">hi</b> &#8212; <span class="mdoc-desc">print greeting messages</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mdoc-section">
				<h1>LIBRARY</h1>
				<span class="mdoc-lib">library &#8220;libgreeting&#8221;</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mdoc-section">
				<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
				<b class="mdoc-includes">#include &lt;<span class="mdoc-link-includes">hello.h</span>&gt;</b><br/>
				<b class="mdoc-includes">#include &lt;<span class="mdoc-link-includes">hi.h</span>&gt;</b><p></p>
				<i class="mdoc-ftype">int</i><br/>
				<b class="mdoc-fname">hello</b>(<i class="mdoc-farg">int C</i>, <i class="mdoc-farg">const char *prefix</i>);<p></p>
				<i class="mdoc-ftype">void</i><br/>
				<b class="mdoc-fname">hi</b>();
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Already, a manual reader has lots of pertinent information: the name of the library, its header file, and the function
			calling syntax.  Let's continue in documenting the functions and their arguments, but this time, we'll do so in a
			different style than before.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead of using lists, we describe each function as a free-form stream of text.  We depend on the <span
				class="sec">SYNOPSIS</span> to hint the reader as to the function argument types; there's no need to re-state
			them.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Sh DESCRIPTION
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fn hi
			<br />
			and
			<br />
			.Fn hello
			<br />
			functions print out greeting messages.
			<br />
			.Pp
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fn hi
			<br />
			function accepts no arguments and prints out
			<br />
			.Qq hello, world .
			<br />
			.Pp
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fn hello
			<br />
			function accepts a value
			<br />
			.Fa C ,
			<br />
			which if non-zero indicates output should be uppercase; and
			<br />
			.Fa prefix ,
			<br />
			which, if non-NULL, shall be prefixed to the output.
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fa prefix
			<br />
			argument, if non-NULL, must be nil-terminated.
		</div>
		<p>
			Notice how each sentence in this fragment ends on its own line, for example,
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			which, if non-NULL, shall be prefixed to the output.
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fa prefix
		</div>
		<p>
			By doing so, the formatter is able to recognise the end of sentence and correctly handle sentential spacing.  In most
			cases, this means adding two spaces between the period and subsequent text.  From this follows a rule of thumb, <q>new
				sentence, new line</q>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this <span class="sec">DESCRIPTION</span> we've captured what each function does and what its arguments are.  What
			remains are return values.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Sh RETURN VALUES
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fn hi
			<br />
			function does not return a value.
			<br />
			.Pp
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Fn hello
			<br />
			function returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.
		</div>
		<p>
			Let's collect these fragments into a single document and see if it's enough to use as a programming reference.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocout">

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			We'll use our mental checklist as a guide.  First we stipulated linking information with the <a
				href="macros.xml#macro_lb" class="macro">Lb</a> macro.  Then we introduced the calling syntax of each
			function, naming their arguments.  We also stipulated the necessary header files in the order they'd be included in
			source files.  In the <span class="sec">DESCRIPTION</span>, we described each function and its arguments in full.
			Lastly, we documented return values in the <span class="sec">RETURN VALUES</span> section.
		</p>
		<p>
			From this information, a programmer should be able to interface with our library.
