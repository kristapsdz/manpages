		<h3>
			Input Encoding
		</h3>
		<p>
			Without exception, a well-formed <span class="lang">mdoc</span> document consists only of <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xml#ascii">ASCII</a> printable characters, the space character, the newline character, and in
			some cases the tab character.  Most modern formatters allow for CR+LF newlines <span class="screen">\r\n</span>, but
			this is not portable.  Modern formatters also accommodate for unlimit to line length; this is not necessarily the case
			for legacy formatters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unilaterally, the backslash <span class="screen">\</span> is always interpreted as the beginning of an <a
				href="part2-1-2.xml#escape_sequences">escape sequence</a>.  If an escape precedes a newline, it escapes the
			current line:
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em This is considered one \
			<br />
			line of input.
		</div>
		<h4 id="macro_line">
			Macro Line
		</h4>
		<p>
			Formally speaking, a macro line is one beginning with a control character.  In <span class="lang">mdoc</span>, this is
			traditionally the <span class="screen">.</span> character, although historical documents may also use the <span
				class="screen">'</span> character.  This notation extends back to the historical <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xml#runoff">RUNOFF</a> utility.
		</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/CC-244.html">
			<p>
				<span class="under">Control Words</span>:
			</p>
			<p>
				Input generally consists of English text, 360 or  fewer characters to a line.  Control words must begin a new
				line, and begin with a period so that they  may  be  distinguished from other text.  RUNOFF does not print the
				control  words.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			A line with only a control character followed by zero or more whitespace characters is stripped from input.
		</p>
		<p>
			A macro line may, in some circumstances, contain more macros.  The first macro &mdash; the one following the control
			character &mdash; may then be distinguished as the line macro.
		</p>
		<p>
			On macro lines the following non-alphanumeric characters are syntactically meaningful as follows.  These characters are
			collectively called reserved characters.

		<p>
			To pass these characters along as literal text, you must either escape or quote them.
		</p>
		<p>
			If an unescaped space character is encountered on a macro line, it is used to delimit macros, macro arguments, and
			flags.  Multiple consecutive space characters have no effect on output.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World
			<br />
			.Em Hello, World
		</div>
		<p>
			The spaces between <span class="screen">Hello,</span> and <span class="screen">world</span> delimit arguments in this
			case, and produce the same output of <i>Hello, World</i> without extra spaces.
		</p>
		<h4 id="text_line">
			Text Line
		</h4>
		<p>
			A text line is any line <i>not</i> beginning with a control character.  Text lines are never parsed for macros and may
			consist of printable ASCII character.  Text lines are concatenated together when forming output, so unless in certain
			circumstances, newlines are stripped from input.  Using a blank text line as a vertical separator is not portable.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a space character is encountered on a text line, it is reproduced verbatim in the output.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World
			<br />
			Hello, World
		</div>
		<p>
			The spaces between <span class="screen">Hello,</span> and <span class="screen">world</span> will be reproduced in both
			cases as-is.  However, it is considered non-portable to use spaces on a text-line to shape output: <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xml#html">HTML</a>, for example, by default collapses whitespace.  Secondly, consider whether
			controlled spacing between text in an otherwise free-form text sequence is appropriate.  In most space-retaining cases,
			such as in source code examples, you're better off with a literal display mode such as covered at the end of this
			section.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Do not</b> use the space-retaining feature to create double-spaces following a sentential period!  See <a
				href="part2-1-5.xml#sentential_punctuation">Sentential Punctuation</a> for how to do this properly.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the first letter of a text line is a space character, the output line shall be preceded by a newline.  This creates
			the effect of an implicit literal display.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Hello, World.
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The newline, leading spaces, and in-line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacing are retained.
			<br />
			This is free-form text.
		</div>
		<p>
			The portability of this behaviour is unknown.  For greater portability (and semantic annotation), a literal display mode
			should be opened instead with, for example, the <a class="macro" href="macros.xml#macro_bd">Bd</a> <span
				class="macroflag">literal</span>:
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Hello, World.
			<br />
			.Bd -literal -compact
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The newline and leading spaces are retained.
			<br />
			.Ed
			<br />
			While this is not.
		</div>
		<p>
			In this example, the <span class="macroflag">compact</span> flag prevents leading vertical space.  To effect a vertical
			space following the literal display, use a <a class="macro" href="macros.xml#macro_pp">Pp</a>.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Consider the following example:
			<br />
			.Bd -literal
			<br />
			int a_function(int *foo, int bar) {
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*foo += bar;
			<br />
			}
			<br />
			.Ed
			<br />
			.Pp
			<br />
			This is subsequent text.
